<div class="row">
    The project entails creating a server-side application with Java to manage a Frequent Flier program, connected to a database for handling operations such as user authentication, viewing flight details, managing awards, and transferring points. Additionally, it requires building an Android mobile application that interacts with the server-side components to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the program's features. This comprehensive system aims to demonstrate a practical implementation of server-client communication and database management in a real-world application scenario, culminating in a video demonstration of the working application.
